# Battleship

A C++ implementation of the classic board game Battleship.
The project contains three files, battleshipboard.h, battleshipboard.cpp, and battleshipgame.cpp.
The header file is for defining the function prototypes, as well as for creating constant variables, and structs.
The battleshipboard.cpp is for defining the game logic, and rules, validation, as well as printing the user boards.
The battleshipgame.cpp is the client file that contains the main function, as is responsible for implementing the game program flow.
